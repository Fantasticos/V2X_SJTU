# V2X_SJTU
## Inroduction
A repository of basic codes and usage instructions for [Mokar V2X devices](https://www.huali-tec.com/project.php). The project is sponsored by Shanghai Jiaotong University.

Here are some introductions and tutorials for the V2X device. Honestly speaking, I 'm just a beginner in this field. My document and tutorial contain only some basic ways to code & run programs on the V2X device.
